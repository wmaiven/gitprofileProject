HIII! first I want to thank you for participating in this selection process, 
this company really caught my attention for the quality of how they treat the participants 
and for what I read in the reviews about you on the internet, I hope you like the project!

The project was done in Node js with express flamework to create routes and axios for consumption 
and creation of the api, and for front end i used ejs with bootstrap and bodyparser

I tried to create tests with jest but it didn't work :( but I left the configuration and the folder 
created in case I find out how to make it work!

I created the search user functionality that was not required in the project but I thought it was a good idea to put it

I believe you already know, but to run it, just run npm install and then npx nodemon index.js or node index.js

I couldn't validate my user with github so my api#rate-limiting is very little but enough to test all the features

Again thanks for the opportunity! :)

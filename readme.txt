The project was done in Node js with express flamework to create routes and axios for consumption 
and creation of the api, and for front end i used ejs with bootstrap and bodyparser

I tried to create tests with jest but it didn't work :( but I left the configuration and the folder 
created in case I find out how to make it work!

I created the search user functionality that was not required in the project but I thought it was a good idea to put it

I believe you already know, but to run it, just run npm install and then npx nodemon index.js or node index.js

I couldn't validate my user with github so my api#rate-limiting is very little but enough to test all the features
